# statistiche coronavirus
This projects aims to show some statistics about coronavirus in Italy.
It's made without js framework and it's a single page app
The skeleton has been forked by Rishav Sharan
No frameworks or build tools are needed to run this.
But one will need a web server to serve the html and the js to the browser.
We can use live-server: live-server --port:8082
